        <li> Stir sauce into quinoa mixture; cook and stir until evenly coated, about 2 minutes. </li>
        <li>Make well in the center of the quinoa mixture. Pour eggs into the well; cook and stir until eggs are scrambled and cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. Add peas and cook until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes. Add remaining scallion.       </li>
